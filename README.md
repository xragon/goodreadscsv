# GoodReads CSV Importer

This will take the goodreads CSV export and read a subset of fields into a database

## Development Plan
1. Hard coded import of CSV file - DONE
2. Handle the imported CSV so that I can pick and choose the fields I want - IN PROGRESS
3. Command line control so I can execute the code on whichever file I choose
4. Write chosen files to a postgres DB
